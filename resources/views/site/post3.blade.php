        <h3>Cool. But why?</h3>
        <p>VinumDay is brazilian a wine company that I worked for and, as you can see <a href="/user-experience-analysis-for-a-wine-retail-ecommerce">in this article</a>, I made them an entire UX and web data analysis in wich we realized their clients were super loyal. Their user’s lifetime value is really high and <strong>over 80% of their revenue</strong> is provided by <strong>returning visitors</strong>.</p>

        <h3>The proccess and result</h3>
        <p>This project was a huge and awesome work, it started on ideation using benchmarks like Spotify’s wrapped and making it work in the wine world. Then content creation. Then moodboarding. Then brand guide studying. Then wireframing. Then UI design and finally animating <s>(actually, I also developed it all)</s>.</p>
        <p>The result is what you can see in this Youtube video:</p>
