    Designing dashboards is one of my specialties. The clients tell me a problem they need to solve and I’m able to create a visual and ease to understand solution rather it’s a graphic, a board or a data table.

        <p>As you can see in my portfolio, I’ve worked a lot with <strong>wine</strong> <s>(I also enjoy drinking it)</s>. This dashboard was made for VinumDay’s wine providers. They wanted to give their providers the chance to see how their sales on the platform were going and also register their new wines.</p>
