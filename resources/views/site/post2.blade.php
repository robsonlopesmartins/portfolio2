        <h3>What is Oto?</h3>
        <p>Oto is a web platform + app that helps <strong>retail sales reps</strong> connect to their clients throught WhatsAapp, giving them all the information they need to make a good sell. Oto also helps the brands get information about their clients, turn it into insights and then act on them to <strong>improve sales</strong>.</p>

        <h3>The problem</h3>
        <p>Oto is awesome, it helps a lot. But that is at the same time a solution and a problem, the truth is Oto is very hard to explain because it was made to help the sales rep, their managers and also the brands. And there are several features to help each one of these personas. </p>
        <p>The stakeholders wanted the homepage to show the <strong>why</strong> behind it, some big numbers and the problematic. But also show *all of the features*, clients <strong>AND</strong> have a lead form.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="container text-container">
        <h3>Solution and result</h3>
        <p>The process was based on <strong>wireframing</strong> and <strong>testing</strong>. In this case I had to wireframe a lot of versions until we got to the point we wanted.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="img-container">
        <img src="img/posts/img2-2.png" alt="Webpage wireframe">
    </div>
    <div class="container text-container margin-top">
        <p>The solution to show all the features was to separete them in the personas they were made for. So in the beggining we introduced the personas and then opened a slider with all the features for each one of them. But that was made in a way that you don’t have a huge scroll and tons of information at once.</p>
        <p>Without further ado, here is the <strong>final result</strong> on Figma:</p>

    <div class="img-container">
