        <h3>The process</h3>
        <p>My first step was starting <strong>making questions</strong>. That’s the initial point in every job for me because I like to really dive deep and <strong>understand the business</strong> and clients I’m working with. I wrote down some questions like:</p>

        <ul class="list-text">
            <li>Who are the clients?</li>
            <li>How much visitors the website has in a month?</li>
            <li>What are the flows users take before they purchase? Do we have a funnel?</li>
            <li>How much revenue is generated in a moth? What is the profit margin?</li>
            <li>In wich device the website has more views? Wich one of them converts better?</li>
            <li>What is the <strong>lifetime value</strong> of the clients?</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Some of those questions were all business, so I asked the stakeholders. The others I had to answer by myself with data, using <strong>Google Analytics</strong>!</p>

        <h3>Here are some insights I had during the research</h3>
        <p>My first insight was about device. You’re now going to see some pieces of the final slideshow I made:</p>

    <div class="img-container">

    </div>
    <div class="container text-container margin-top">
        <p>Also, we realized that most visitors were new, but returning visitors represented <strong>82,79% of revenue</strong>. </p>
        <p>That means two things <strong class="special">1)</strong> Their clients are loyal, they like what they buy and then return and <strong class="special">2)</strong> We have a huge opportunity to loyalize that 79% new visitors and make them become clients. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="img-container">
        <img src="img/posts/img4-3.png" alt="Returning users">
    </div>



    <div class="container text-container margin-top">
        <p><strong>Then what should we do?</strong></p>

        <div class="inner-level">
            <div class="level-block">
                <span class="number">1)</span>
                <p>Make your returning visitors feel special throught page personalization so they can purchase even more.</p>
                <img src="img/posts/img4-4.png" alt="Welcome back with profile resume">
            </div>
            <div class="level-block">
                <span class="number">2)</span>
                <p>We need an incentive for the new users! It’s worth it, <strong>their LTV is very high</strong> and they’re loyal clients, we should offer a <strong>first purchase discount</strong> for new users.</p>

        <p>These are just 2 out of <strong>26 suggestions</strong> and lots of insights I presented to VinumDay. But I don’t want to get you bored so I’m stopping here. Thanks for reading ❤️</p>
